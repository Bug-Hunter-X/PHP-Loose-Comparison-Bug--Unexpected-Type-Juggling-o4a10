The solution is to consistently use strict comparison (`===`) which checks for both value and type equality, preventing unintended type coercion:

```php
function checkValue($value) {
  if ($value === '0') {
    echo "Value is '0'";
  } else if ($value === 0) {
    echo "Value is 0 (integer)";
  } else if ($value === false){
    echo "Value is boolean false";
  } else {
    echo "Value is something else";
  }
}

checkValue('0'); // Outputs: Value is '0'
checkValue(0);   // Outputs: Value is 0 (integer)
checkValue(false); //Outputs: Value is boolean false
```
By using strict comparison, the function now correctly distinguishes between different types and values, avoiding the pitfalls of loose comparison and ensuring the code behaves as intended.
