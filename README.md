# PHP Loose Comparison Bug

This repository demonstrates a common error in PHP related to loose comparisons and type juggling.  The `bug.php` file shows how using `==` instead of `===` can lead to unexpected and incorrect behavior in conditional statements when dealing with different data types such as strings, integers, booleans and null values. The `bugSolution.php` offers a corrected version.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `bug.php` and observe the output. Note the unexpected results due to the loose comparisons.
3. Run `bugSolution.php` to see how using strict comparisons (`===`) resolves the issue.

## Lesson Learned

Always prefer strict comparisons (`===`) over loose comparisons (`==`) in PHP to avoid unexpected behavior caused by type juggling.  Strict comparison ensures both the value and the type are identical before evaluating to true, thus avoiding these subtle errors.
