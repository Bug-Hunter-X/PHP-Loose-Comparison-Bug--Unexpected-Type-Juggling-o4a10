In PHP, a common yet subtle error arises when dealing with loosely typed variables and unexpected type juggling. Consider this scenario:

```php
function checkValue($value) {
  if ($value == '0') {
    echo "Value is '0'";
  } else if ($value === 0) {
    echo "Value is 0 (integer)";
  } else {
    echo "Value is something else";
  } 
}

checkValue('0'); // Outputs: Value is '0'
checkValue(0);   // Outputs: Value is '0'
checkValue(false); //Outputs: Value is '0' 
```

The seemingly straightforward comparison `$value == '0'` uses loose comparison, where PHP might implicitly convert types.  This results in `false` evaluating as `'0'` because in a loose comparison context PHP considers `false` to be equal to  `0`  which is equal to `'0'`. The strict comparison (`===`) checks for both value and type, but the loose comparison can lead to unexpected behavior and hidden bugs if not carefully considered.
